For 17+ years, I've been turning ambitious technology visions into production reality—from multi-agent AI platforms processing 30M+ images monthly to data lakes powering billions in business decisions.\n\nAs a Senior Solutions Architect at AWS, I partner with enterprises on their most critical transformations. Whether it's reducing AI inference costs to <$10K/month, achieving 99.9% uptime at massive scale, or enabling 2K+ practitioners across global markets, I focus on outcomes that move business metrics.\n\nMy sweet spot: Generative AI architectures, cloud-native systems, and strategic initiatives where technology leadership meets measurable impact—$300M+ in influenced revenue and growing.",
